## Ingredients
- Baguette
- [Nutella](http://www.nutellausa.com/)
- Peanut Butter
- Nanner

## Directions

Spread a healthy amount of Nutella on to a baguette, and place as much peanut butter as you feel acceptable on to the other half of the baguette.

Slice banana into `1/2cm` slices and place in a row on the baguette and combine two halves together and take your first bite into bliss.

Optional, to make a tribute to Elvis, spread one side of the bread with peanut butter and the other with Nutella
